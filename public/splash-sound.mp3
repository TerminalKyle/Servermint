# Splash Sound File Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the splash sound file.

To add your own splash sound:

1. Replace this file with an actual .mp3 audio file
2. Recommended duration: 2-3 seconds
3. Recommended format: MP3 or WAV
4. Keep file size under 500KB for fast loading

You can also create a .wav version as a fallback by placing a file named "splash-sound.wav" in this same directory.

The sound will play at 30% volume when the app starts.
